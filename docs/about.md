# About

This application was built out of the desire to trade for a more robust financial portfolio.
The concern is, how to we trade Crypto and take advantage of the volatility during the night
while one is sleeping? Well, this is what bots, machines, and code is good at.

[Philip De Lorenzo](mailto:philip.delorenzo@gmail.com), is a developer, engineer, SRE, and
dabbles in trading. The reason for this application is that, this is not adopting any strategy.
It provides you with the ability to create your own strategies, test them against previous data
with neural networks _(AI)_ and make the trader aware of the profits that the current strategy
being tested would yield.
